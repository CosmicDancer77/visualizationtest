name: Scheduled Python Script

# 1. Define the Trigger: When should this workflow run?
on:
  # Schedule the workflow to run every 30 minutes using cron syntax
  schedule:
    # This cron expression means "at minute 0 and minute 30, every hour, every day"
    # Cron format: min hour day_of_month month day_of_week
    - cron: '0,30 * * * *'
  
  # Allow manual runs from the GitHub Actions tab (optional but helpful)
  workflow_dispatch:

# 2. Define the Job: What actual tasks should be performed?
jobs:
  run_script:
    # Specify the runner environment (e.g., a virtual machine)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Define the steps for the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Python environment
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.x' # Use a recent Python version

      # Step 3: (Optional) Install dependencies if your script needs them
      # If you have a requirements.txt file, uncomment the following step:
      # - name: Install dependencies
      #   run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Run the Python script
      - name: Execute Python script
        run: .src/scheduled_1.py
